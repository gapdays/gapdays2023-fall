## GAP Days in general

[GAP](https://www.gap-system.org/) Days are meetings where developers and users
with GAP programming experience are invited to discuss, influence, and
contribute to the future development of GAP. To streamline each meeting, the
organisers usually suggest a few main topics to work on during the week.

The meetings are also suitable for advertising recent developments in GAP
itself, and its packages, via short talks.  However, the focus of the meetings
is on development, with talks playing only a minor role.  As enough GAP experts
will be around for advice and technical support, the meetings offer particularly
good opportunities for people to work on their own packages. At the end of the
week, we would be happy to hear about any progress you made.

Please visit [gapdays.de](https://www.gapdays.de) for a list of all GAP Days.

## {{ site.title }}

The focus of these GAP Days will be on the GAP Package distribution
and its infrastructure.
Please visit the [topics page]({{ site.baseurl }}/topics) for details.

The schedule can be found on [the program page]({{ site.baseurl }}/program).

<!--
automation (introduction to GitHub Actions, setting up continuous integration tests and code coverage reporting, etc.) and an overhaul of the GAP release process (hopefully culminating in a new GAP release).

We will also include a small number of talks during the GAP Days about the GAP infrastructure and functionalities of GitHub.

While we do not want to discourage non-GAP-core programmers, we want to underline that the focus will be on working the release system of GAP.
There will be talks and some "hands-on" sessions to give everyone the opportunity to learn the tools needed that will be most likely utilised in the release process.
For anyone who wants to attend but feels out of depth in this, we will be looking for testers and other higher level tasks.
