    In this talk, I'll explain about the GAP package distribution: what it does,
    how it works, and how new packages are added to it. For this, the viewpoints
    of users, package authors and maintainers of the package distribution
    will be considered.

    <details>

    <blockquote><small>
    Packages are an important part of the GAP ecosystem, but the process of
    installing and updating packages has long been manual and laborious, with
    significant technical knowledge required.  This has the potential to put
    off newcomers, and makes it harder to share our code.  Since 2018, a
    package management system has been in development, in the form of a GAP
    package called PackageManager.  This reached some level of maturity with a
    1.0 release in 2020, and is used regularly by at least some people, but it
    still lacks many features that might be desirable.  In this talk, we will
    consider what PackageManager does, what it doesn't do, and what its future
    should look like.
